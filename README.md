Adding multiple Pools
================

Setting up multiple Pools in Config is very easy

<pre>
dict set pools btc apiurl 		"https://pool1.tld/"
dict set pools btc apikey   	"YOURMPOSAPIKEY"

dict set pools ltc apiurl 		"https://pool2.tld/"
dict set pools ltc apikey   	"YOURMPOSAPIKEY"
</pre>

You can add as many as you want. For example, the Value "btc" is the Pool Name, used to query the Pool.
Apiurl and Apikey are the Values from your MPOS installation. So, if your Pool Name is set to "btc"
you can query the bot with following command

<pre>
!pool BTC
</pre>

Querying userinfos works like that

<pre>
!user BTC USERNAME
</pre>

Creating self defined Output
================

In output.tcl, there are predefined output variables. If you want to create your own message that will
be posted to channel or by private message, you have to create your own text in the putput variables
of each section. Now there are predefined standard messages, which can be used to post the relevant
information. You can also use different messages based on coins you set in config.tcl

Standard Output looks like this and is predefined
<pre>
set output_balance "Coin: \0032%balance_coin%\003\
| User: %balance_user%\
| Confirmed: %balance_confirmed%\
| Unconfirmed: %balance_unconfirmed%\
| Orphan: %balance_orphan%"
</pre>

Customized output can look like this and is disabled by default
<pre>
set output_balance_percoin(btc) "Coin: \0032%balance_coin%\003 - test output btc"
set output_balance_percoin(ltc) "Coin: \0032%balance_coin%\003 - test output ltc"
</pre>
Customized output can be set for every coin added to config

USAGE
================

If you are on IRC and the Bot sits in your channel, type one of the following commands to
communicate with the bot and get the output right in the channel

<pre>
!adduser ircnick                         - Adding User to userfile"
!deluser ircnick                         - Deleting User from userfile"
!block POOLNAME                          - Blockstats
!pool POOLNAME                           - Pool Information
!round POOLNAME                          - Actual Round Information
